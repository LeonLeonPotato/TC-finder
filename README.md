# TC-finder

Finds test cases for competitive programming. WIP.

## Supported platforms:
Linux (tested) \
MacOS (untested, but should work)

## Arguments
`--help` — produces help message and exits \
`--gen` — path to test case generator \
`--bf` — path to brute forcer\
`--solver` — your solution

Important: All paths need to lead to executable files, auto-compilation will come in the future (never).

Threading will also come in the future.
